# Pandoc\{omatic\} Configuration Files #
This is my Pandoc data directory contents (default location: `$HOME/.local/share/pandoc/` on macOS and Linux), that largely get called automagically using [`pandocomatic`](https://github.com/htdebeer/pandocomatic) via my [`pandocomatic.yaml`](https://github.com/iandol/dotpandoc/blob/master/pandocomatic.yaml) configuration. I run this triggered via Scrivener's post-processing compile feature; see [Scrivomatic](https://github.com/iandol/scrivomatic) for more details of this workflow. I've collected several [Pandoc templates](https://github.com/iandol/dotpandoc/tree/master/templates), and use a [set of filters to transform Academic metadata](https://github.com/iandol/dotpandoc/tree/master/filters) to multiple outputs.
